<H1><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="pcpatr.html#TOC2">2  The PATR-II Formalism</A></H1>

<P>
The PATR-II formalism can be viewed as a computer language for
encoding linguistic information.  It does not presuppose any particular
theory of syntax.  It was originally developed by Stuart M. Shieber at
Stanford University in the early 1980's (Shieber 1984, Shieber 1986).
A PATR-II grammar consists of a set of rules and a lexicon.  Each
rule consists of a context-free <EM>phrase structure rule</EM> and a set
of <EM>feature constraints</EM>, that is, <EM>unifications</EM> on the
<EM>feature structures</EM> associated with the constituents of the
phrase structure rules.  The lexicon provides the items that can
replace the terminal symbols of the phrase structure rules, that is,
the words of the language together with their relevant features.

</UL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="pcpatr.html#TOC3">2.1  Phrase structure rules</A></H2>

<P>
Context-free phrase structure rules should be familiar to anyone who
has studied either linguistic theory or computer science.  They look
like this:

<PRE>

LHS -&#62; RHS_1 RHS_2 ...

</PRE>

<P>
<SAMP>`LHS'</SAMP> (the symbol to the left of the arrow) is a nonterminal
symbol for the type of phrase that is being described.  To the right of
the arrow is an ordered list of the constituents of the phrase.  These
constituents are either nonterminal symbols, appearing on the left hand
side of some rule in the grammar, or terminal symbols, representing
basic classes of elements from the lexicon.  These basic classes
usually correspond to what are commonly called <EM>parts of speech</EM>.
In PATR-II, the terminal and nonterminal symbols are both
referred to as <EM>categories</EM>.

</P>

</PRE>

<P>
Consider the PC-PATR style context-free phrase structure grammar
in figure 1.  It has ten nonterminal symbols (S, NP,
Det, VP, VerbalP, AuxP, PrepP, AdjP, AdvP, and SubCl), and nine terminal
symbols (N, PR, DT, V, AUX, PP, AV, AJ, and CJ).  This grammar
describes a small subset of English sentences.  Several aspects of this
grammar are worth mentioning.

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Optional constituents (or sets of constituents) on the right hand
side are enclosed in parentheses.
<LI>

Alternative constituents (or sets of constituents) on the right
hand side are separated by slashes.
<LI>

Braces are used to group alternative sets of elements together,
so that alternations are not ambiguous.
<LI>

Symbols should not be repeated verbatim within a rule.  Repeated
symbols should be distinguished from each other by adding a different
index number to a symbol each time it is repeated.  Index numbers are
introduced by the underscore (<CODE>_</CODE>) character.

</PRE>

<P>
A significant amount of grammar development can be done just with
context-free phrase structure rules such as these.  For example,
parsing the sentence "the man sees us with a telescope" with this
simple grammar produces a parse tree like that shown in figure
2.  (In order to minimize the height of parse trees
without needing to use a graphical interface, PC-PATR actually draws
parse trees like the one shown in figure 3.)
Parsing the similar sentence "we see the man with a telescope"
produces two different parses as shown in figure 4,
correctly showing the ambiguity between whether we used a telescope to
see the man, or the man had a telescope when we saw him.

</PRE>

<P>
A fundamental problem with context-free phrase structure grammars is
that they tend to grossly overgenerate.  For example, the sample
grammar would incorrectly recognize the sentence "*he see the man with
a telescope", assigning it tree structures similar to those shown in
figure 4.  With only the simple categories used by
context-free phrase structure rules, a very large number of rules are
required to accurately handle even a small subset of a language's
grammar.  This is the primary motivation behind feature structures, the
basic enhancement of PATR-II over context-free phrase structure
grammars.<A NAME="DOCF2" HREF="pcpatr.html#FOOT2">(2)</A>

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="pcpatr.html#TOC4">2.2  Feature structures</A></H2>

<P>
The basic data structure of the PATR-II formalism is called a
<EM>feature structure</EM>.  A feature structure contains one or more
<EM>features</EM>.  A feature consists of an attribute name and a value.
Feature structures are commonly written as attribute-value matrices
like this (example 1):

<PRE>

(1)     [ lex: telescope
		  cat: N ]

</PRE>

<P>
where <EM>lex</EM> and <EM>cat</EM> are attribute names, and
<EM>telescope</EM> and <EM>N</EM> are the values for those attributes.  Note
that the feature structure is enclosed in brackets.  Each feature
occurs on a separate line, with the name coming first, followed by a
colon and then its value.  Feature names and (simple) values are single
words consisting of alphanumeric characters.

</P>
<P>
Feature structures can have either simple values, such as the example
above, or complex values, such as this (example 2):

<PRE>

(2)     [ lex:      telescope
		  cat:      N
		  gloss:    `telescope
		  head:     [ agr:    [ 3sg: + ]
					  number: SG
					  pos:    N
					  proper: -
					  verbal: - ]
		  root_pos: N ]

</PRE>

<P>
where the value of the <EM>head</EM> feature is another feature
structure, that also contains an embedded feature structure.  Feature
structures can be arbitrarily nested in this manner.

</P>
<P>
Portions of a feature structure can be referred to using the
<EM>path</EM> notation.  A path is a sequence of one or more feature names
enclosed in angled brackets (<CODE>&#60;&#62;</CODE>).  For instance, examples
3-5
would all be valid feature paths based on the feature structure of
example 2:

<PRE>

(3)     &#60;head&#62;
(4)     &#60;head number&#62;
(5)     &#60;head agr 3sg&#62;

</PRE>

<P>
Paths are used in feature templates and feature constraints, described
below.

</P>
<P>
Different features within a feature structure can share values.  This
is not the same thing as two features having identical values.  In
Example 6 below, the <CODE>&#60;head agr&#62;</CODE> and
<CODE>&#60;subj head agr&#62;</CODE> features have identical values, but in
Example 7, they share the same value:

</P>

<PRE>
(6)     [ cat:  S
		  pred: [ cat:  VP
				  head: [ agr:    [ 3sg: + ]
						  finite: +
						  pos:    V
						  tense:  PAST
						  vform:  ED ] ]
		  subj: [ cat:  NP
				  head: [ agr:    [ 3sg: + ]
						  case:   NOM
						  number: SG
						  pos:    N
						  proper: -
						  verbal: - ] ] ]

<P>
Shared values are indicated by the coindexing markers
<CODE>$1</CODE>, <CODE>$2</CODE>, and so on.

</P>
<P>
Note that upper and lower case letters used in feature names and values
are distinctive.  For example, <EM>NUMBER</EM> is not the same as
<EM>Number</EM> or <EM>number</EM>.  (This is also true of the symbols used in
the context-free phrase structure rules.)

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="pcpatr.html#TOC5">2.3  Unification</A></H2>

<P>
<EM>Unification</EM> is the basic operation applied to feature
structures in PC-PATR.  It consists of the merging of the
information from two feature structures.  Two feature structures can
unify if their common features have the same values, but do not unify
if any feature values conflict.

</P>
<P>
Consider the following feature structures:

<PRE>

(8)     [ agreement: [ number: singular
					   person: first ] ]

(9)     [ agreement: [ number: singular ]
		  case:      nominative ]

(10)    [ agreement: [ number: singular
					   person: third ] ]

(11)    [ agreement: [ number: singular
					   person: first ]
		  case:      nominative ]

(12)    [ agreement: [ number: singular
					   person: third ]
		  case:      nominative ]

</PRE>

<P>
Feature 9 can unify with either feature 8
(producing feature 11) or feature 10 (producing
feature 12).  However, feature 8 cannot unify with
feature 10 due to the conflict in the values of their
<CODE>&#60;agreement person&#62;</CODE> features.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="pcpatr.html#TOC6">2.4  Feature constraints</A></H2>

<P>
The feature constraints associated with phrase structure rules in PATR-II
consist of a set of unification expressions (the <EM>unification
constraints</EM>).  Each unification expression has three parts, in this
order:

<OL>
<LI>

a feature path, the first element of which is one of the symbols from
the phrase structure rule
<LI>

an equal sign (<CODE>=</CODE>)
<LI>

either a simple value, or another feature path that also starts with a
symbol from the phrase structure rule
</OL>

<P>
As an example, consider the following PC-PATR rules:

<PRE>

(13)	Rule S -&#62; NP VP (SubCl)
		&#60;NP head agr&#62;  = &#60;VP head agr&#62;
		&#60;NP head case&#62; = NOM
		&#60;S subj&#62;       = &#60;NP&#62;
		&#60;S head&#62;       = &#60;VP head&#62;

(14)	Rule NP -&#62; {(Det) (AJ) N (PrepP)} / PR
		&#60;Det head number&#62; = &#60;N head number&#62;
		&#60;NP head&#62;         = &#60;N head&#62;
		&#60;NP head&#62;         = &#60;PR head&#62;

</PRE>

<P>
Rule 13 has two feature constraints that limit the co-occurrence of NP
and VP, and two feature constraints that build the feature structures for
S.  This highlights the dual purpose of feature constraints in PC-PATR:
limiting the co-occurrence of phrase structure elements and constructing
the feature structure for the element defined by a rule.  The first
constraint states that the NP and VP <CODE>&#60;head agr&#62;</CODE> features must
unify successfully, and also modifies both of those features if they do
unify.  The second constraint states that NP's <CODE>&#60;head case&#62;</CODE> feature
must either be equal to <CODE>NOM</CODE> or else be undefined.  In the latter
case, it is set equal to <CODE>NOM</CODE>.  The last two constraints create a
new feature structure for S from the feature structures for NP and VP.

</P>
<P>
Rule 14 illustrates another important point about feature unification
constraints:  they are applied only if they involve the phrase
structure constituents actually found for the rule.

<P>
Figure 5 shows the grammar of
figure 1 augmented with a number of feature constraints.
With this grammar (and a suitable lexicon), the parse output shown in
figure 2 would include the sentence feature
structure, as shown in figure 6.  Note that the
<CODE>&#60;subj head agr&#62;</CODE> and <CODE>&#60;pred head agr&#62;</CODE> features
share a common value as a result of the feature constraint unifications
associated with the rule <CODE>S -&#62; NP VP (SubCl)</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
PC-PATR allows disjunctive feature unification constraints with its
phrase structure rules.  Consider rules 15 and 16 below.  These two rules
have the same phrase structure rule part.  They can therefore be
collapsed into the single rule 17, which has a disjunction in its
unification constraints.

<PRE>

<P>
Not only does PC-PATR allow disjunctive unification constraints, but it
also allows disjunctive phrase structure rules.  Consider rule 18: it is
very similar to rule 17.  These two rules can be further combined to form
rule 19, which has disjunctions in both its phrase structure rule and its
unification constraints.

<PRE>

</PRE>

<P>
Since the open brace (<CODE>{</CODE>) introduces disjunctions both in the
phrase structure rule and in the unification constraints, care must be
taken to avoid confusing PC-PATR when it is loading the grammar
file.  The end of the phrase structure rule, and the beginning of the
unification constraints, is signaled either by the first constraint
beginning with an open angle bracket (<CODE>&#60;</CODE>) or by a colon
(<CODE>:</CODE>).  If the first constraint is part of a disjunction, then the
phrase structure rule must end with a colon.  Otherwise, PC-PATR
will treat the unification constraint as part of the phrase structure
rule, and will shortly complain about syntax errors in the grammar
file.

</P>
<P>
Perhaps it should be noted that disjunctions in phrase structure rules
or unifications are expanded when the grammar file is read.  They serve
only as a convenience for the person writing the rules.

The lexicon provides the basic elements (atoms) of the grammar, which

feature 2 is provided for each lexicon entry.  Unlike
the original implementation of PATR-II, PC-PATR stores
the lexicon in a separate file from the grammar rules.

<H1><A NAME="SEC74" HREF="pcpatr.html#TOC74">4  The PC-PATR Grammar File</A></H1>

<P>
The following specifications apply generally to the grammar file:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Blank lines, spaces, and tabs separate elements of the grammar file from one
another, but are ignored otherwise.
<LI>

The comment character declared by the <CODE>set comment</CODE> command
(see section <A HREF="pcpatr.html#SEC41">3.2.14.4  set comment</A>)
is operative in the grammar file.  The default
comment character is the semicolon (<CODE>;</CODE>).  Comments may be placed
anywhere in the grammar file.  Everything following a comment character
to the end of the line is ignored.
<LI>

A grammar file is divided into fields identified by a small set of keywords.


<OL>
<LI>

<CODE>Rule</CODE> starts a context-free phrase structure rule with its
set of feature constraints.  These rules define how words join together
to form phrases, clauses, or sentences.  The lexicon and grammar are
tied together by using the lexical categories as the terminal symbols
of the phrase structure rules and by using the other lexical features
in the feature constraints.
<LI>

<CODE>Let</CODE> starts a feature template definition.  Feature
templates are used as macros (abbreviations) in the lexicon.  They may
also be used to assign default feature structures to the categories.
<LI>

<CODE>Parameter</CODE> starts a program parameter definition.  These
parameters control various aspects of the program.
<LI>

<CODE>Define</CODE> starts a lexical rule definition.  As noted in Shieber
(1985), something more powerful than just abbreviations for common
feature elements is sometimes needed to represent systematic
relationships among the elements of a lexicon.  This need is met by
lexical rules, which express transformations rather than mere
abbreviations.  Lexical rules serve two primary purposes in PC-PATR:
modifying the feature structures associated with lexicon entries to
produce additional lexicon entries, and modifying the feature structures
produced by a morphological parser to fit the syntactic grammar
description.
<LI>

<CODE>Constraint</CODE> starts a constraint template definition.  Constraint
templates are used as macros (abbreviations) in the grammar file.
<LI>

<CODE>Lexicon</CODE> starts a lexicon section.  This is only for
compatibility with the original PATR-II.  The section name is
skipped over properly, but nothing is done with it.
<LI>

<CODE>Word</CODE> starts an entry in the lexicon.  This is only for
compatibility with the original PATR-II.  The entry is skipped
over properly, but nothing is done with it.<A NAME="DOCF5" HREF="pcpatr.html#FOOT5">(5)</A>
<LI>

<CODE>End</CODE> effectively terminates the file.  Anything following this
keyword is ignored.
<LI>

<CODE>Comment</CODE> starts a comment field.  The rest of the line following
the keyword is skipped over, and everything in following lines until the
next keyword is also ignored.  If you must use a keyword (other than
<CODE>comment</CODE> verbatim in one of the extra lines of a comment, put a
comment character at the beginning of the line containing the keyword.
</OL>

Note that these keywords are not case sensitive:  <CODE>RULE</CODE> is the
same as <CODE>rule</CODE>, and both are the same as <CODE>Rule</CODE>.  Also, in
order to facilitate interaction with the <TT>`Shoebox'</TT> program, any
of the keywords may begin with a backslash <CODE>\</CODE> character.  For
example, <CODE>\Rule</CODE> and <CODE>\rule</CODE> are both acceptable alternatives
to <CODE>RULE</CODE> or <CODE>rule</CODE>.  The abbreviated form <CODE>\co</CODE> is a
special synonym for <CODE>comment</CODE> or <CODE>\comment</CODE>.  Note that there
is no requirement that these keywords appear at the beginning of a line.
<LI>

Except for <CODE>comment</CODE>, each of the fields in the grammar file may
optionally end with a period.  If there is no period, the next keyword
(in an appropriate slot) marks the end of one field and the beginning of
the next.

<H2><A NAME="SEC75" HREF="pcpatr.html#TOC75">4.1  Rules</A></H2>

<P>
A PC-PATR grammar rule has these parts, in the order listed:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>the keyword <CODE>Rule</CODE>

<LI>an optional rule identifier enclosed in braces (<CODE>{}</CODE>)

<LI>a phrase structure rule consisting of the following:


<OL>
<LI>the nonterminal symbol to be expanded

<LI>an arrow (<CODE>-&#62;</CODE>) or equal sign (<CODE>=</CODE>)

<LI>zero or more terminal or nonterminal symbols, possibly marked for

alternation or optionality
</OL>

<LI>an optional colon (<CODE>:</CODE>)

<LI>zero or more unification constraints

<LI>zero or more priority union operations

<LI>zero or more logical constraint operations

<LI>an optional period (<CODE>.</CODE>)

</OL>

<P>
The optional rule identifier consists of one or more words enclosed in
braces.  Its current utility is only as a special form of comment
describing the intent of the rule.  (Eventually it may be used as a tag
for interactively adding and removing rules.)  The only limits on the
rule identifier are that it not contain the comment character and that
it all appears on the same line in the grammar file.

</P>
<P>
The terminal and nonterminal symbols in the rule have the following
characteristics:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Upper and lower case letters used in symbols are considered different.
For example, <CODE>NOUN</CODE> is not the same as <CODE>Noun</CODE>, and neither is
the same as <CODE>noun</CODE>.
<LI>

The symbol <CODE>X</CODE> (capital letter x) may be used to stand for any
terminal or nonterminal.  For example, this rule says that any category
in the grammar rules can be replaced by two copies of the same category
separated by a CJ.

<PRE>

Rule X -&#62; X_1 CJ X_2
		&#60;X cat&#62;  = &#60;X_1 cat&#62;
		&#60;X cat&#62;  = &#60;X_2 cat&#62;
		&#60;X arg1&#62; = &#60;X_1 arg1&#62;
		&#60;X arg1&#62; = &#60;X_2 arg1&#62;

</PRE>

The symbol X can be useful for capturing generalities.  Care must be
taken, since it can be replaced by anything.
<LI>

Index numbers are used to distinguish instances of a symbol that
is used more than once in a rule.  They are added to the end of a
symbol following an underscore character (<CODE>_</CODE>).  This is
illustrated in the rule for X above.
<LI>

The characters <CODE>(){}[]&#60;&#62;=:/</CODE> cannot be used in terminal or
nonterminal symbols since they are used for special purposes in the
grammar file.  The character <CODE>_</CODE> can be used <EM>only</EM> for
attaching an index number to a symbol.
<LI>

By default, the left hand symbol of the first rule in the grammar file
is the start symbol of the grammar.
</UL>

<P>
The symbols on the right hand side of a phrase structure rule may be
marked or grouped in various ways:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Parentheses around an element of the expansion (right hand) part of a
rule indicate that the element is optional. Parentheses may be placed
around multiple elements. This makes an optional group of elements.
<LI>

A forward slash (/) is used to separate alternative elements of the
expansion (right hand) part of a rule.
<LI>

Curly braces can be used for grouping alternative elements. For example the
following says that an S consists of an NP followed by either a TVP
or an IV:

<PRE>

Rule S -&#62; NP {TVP / IV}

</PRE>

<LI>

Alternatives are taken to be as long as possible. Thus if the curly
braces were omitted from the rule above, as in the rule below, the
TVP would be treated as part of the alternative containing the
NP. It would not be allowed before the IV.

<PRE>

Rule S -&#62; NP TVP / IV

</PRE>

<LI>

Parentheses group enclosed elements the same as curly braces
do.  Alternatives and groups delimited by parentheses or curly braces
may be nested to any depth.
</UL>

<P>
The phrase structure rule can be followed by zero or more
<EM>unification constraints</EM> that refer to symbols used in the rule.  A
unification constraint has these parts, in the order listed:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>a feature path that begins with one of the symbols from the phrase

structure rule
<LI>an equal sign

<LI>either another path or a value

</OL>

<P>
A unification constraint that refers only to symbols on the right hand side
of the rule constrains their co-occurrence.  In the following rule and
constraint, the values of the <EM>agr</EM> features for the NP and VP
nodes of the parse tree must unify:

<PRE>

Rule S -&#62; NP VP
		&#60;NP agr&#62; = &#60;VP agr&#62;

</PRE>

<P>
If a unification constraint refers to a symbol on the right hand side of
the rule, and has an atomic value on its right hand side, then the
designated feature must not have a different value.  In the following
rule and constraint, the <EM>head case</EM> feature for the NP node of
the parse tree must either be originally undefined or equal to NOM:

<PRE>

Rule S -&#62; NP VP
		&#60;NP head case&#62; = NOM

</PRE>

<P>
(After unification succeeds, the <EM>head case</EM> feature for the NP
node of the parse tree will be equal to NOM.)

</P>
<P>
A unification constraint that refers to the symbol on the left hand side of
the rule passes information up the parse tree.  In the following rule
and constraint, the value of the <EM>tense</EM> feature is passed from
the VP node up to the S node:

<PRE>

Rule S -&#62; NP VP
		&#60;S tense&#62; = &#60;VP tense&#62;

</PRE>

<P>
See section <A HREF="pcpatr.html#SEC6">2.4  Feature constraints</A>,
for more details about unification constraints.

</P>
<P>
The phrase structure rule can also be followed by zero or more
<EM>priority union operations</EM> that refer to symbols used in the rule.  A
priority union operation has these parts, in the order listed:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>a feature path that begins with one of the symbols from the phrase

structure rule
<LI>a priority union operation sign (<CODE>&#60;=</CODE>)

<LI>either another path or an atomic value

</OL>

<P>
Although priority union operations may be intermingled with unification
constraints following the phrase structure rule, they are applied only
after all unification constraints have succeeded.  Therefore, it makes
more sense to place them after all of the unification constraints as a
reminder of the order of application.

</P>
<P>
Priority union operations may not appear inside a disjunction: if two
rules logically differ only in the application of one priority union or
another, both rules must be written out in full.

</P>
<P>
The phrase structure rule can also be followed by zero or more
<EM>logical constraint operations</EM> that refer to symbols used in the
rule.  A logical constraint operation has these parts, in the order
listed:

<OL>
<LI>a feature path that begins with one of the symbols from the phrase

structure rule
<LI>a logical constraint operation sign (<CODE>==</CODE>)

<LI>a logical constraint expression, or a constraint template label

</OL>

<P>
Although logical constraint operations may be intermingled with
unification constraints or priority union operations following the phrase
structure rule, they are applied only after all unification constraints
have succeeded and all priority union operations have been applied.
Therefore, it makes more sense to place them after all of the unification
constraints, and after any priority union operations, as a reminder of
the order of application.

</P>
<P>
Logical constraint operations may not appear inside a disjunction: if two
rules logically differ only in the application of one logical constraint or
another, both rules must be written out in full.

</P>
<P>
These last two elements of a PC-PATR rule are enhancements to the
original PATR-II formalism.  For this reason, they are discussed in more
detail in the following two sections.

</P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="pcpatr.html#SEC76">Priority union operations</A>
<LI><A HREF="pcpatr.html#SEC77">Logical constraint operations</A>
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="SEC76" HREF="pcpatr.html#TOC76">4.1.1  Priority union operations</A></H3>

<P>
Unification is the only mechanism implemented in the original PATR-II
formulism for merging two feature structures.  There are situations where
the desired percolation of information is not easily expressed in terms
of unification.  For example, consider the following rule (where
<EM>ms</EM> stands for <EM>morphosyntactic features</EM>):

<PRE>

Stem -&#62; Root Deriv:
		&#60;Root ms&#62;  =  &#60;Deriv msFrom&#62;
		&#60;Stem ms&#62;  =  &#60;Root ms&#62;
		&#60;Stem ms&#62;  =  &#60;Deriv msTo&#62;

</PRE>

<P>
The first unification expression above imposes the agreement constraints
for this rule.  The second and third unification expressions attempt to
provide the percolation of information up to the <CODE>Stem</CODE>.  However,
it is quite possible for there to be a conflict between <CODE>&#60;Root ms&#62;</CODE>
and <CODE>&#60;Deriv msTo&#62;</CODE>.  Any such conflict would cause the third
unification expression to fail, causing the rule as a whole to fail.  The
only way around this at present is to provide a large number of
unification expressions that go into greater depth in the feature
structures.  Even then it may not be possible to always avoid conflicts.

</P>
<P>
An additional mechanism for merging feature structures is provided to
properly handle percolation of information: overwriting via priority union.
The notation of the previous example changes slightly to the following:

<PRE>

Stem -&#62; Root Deriv:
		&#60;Root ms&#62;  =  &#60;Deriv msFrom&#62;
		&#60;Stem ms&#62;  =  &#60;Root ms&#62;
		&#60;Stem ms&#62; &#60;=  &#60;Deriv msTo&#62;

</PRE>

<P>
The only change is in the third expression under the rule: the
unification operator <CODE>=</CODE> has been changed to a priority union
operator <CODE>&#60;=</CODE>.  This new operator is the same as unification except
for handling conflicts and storing results.  In unification, a conflict
causes the operation to fail.  In priority union, a conflict is resolved
by taking the value in the right hand feature structure.  In unification,
both the left hand feature structure and the right hand feature structure
are replaced by the unified result.  In priority union, only the left
hand feature structure is replaced by the result.

</P>
<P>
There is one other significant difference between unification and
priority union.  Unification is logically an unordered process; it makes
no difference what order the unification expressions are written.
Priority union, on the other hand, is inherently ordered; a priority
union operation always overrides any earlier priority union (or
unification) result.  For this reason, all unification expressions are
evaluated before any priority union expressions, and the ordering of the
priority union expressions is significant.

</P>
<P>
A BNF grammar for PC-PATR priority union operations follows.

<PRE>

&#60;priority-union&#62; ::= &#60;feature-path&#62; '&#60;=' &#60;feature-path&#62;
				   | &#60;feature-path&#62; '&#60;=' &#60;ATOM&#62;

&#60;feature-path&#62;   ::= '&#60;' &#60;label-list&#62; '&#62;'

&#60;label-list&#62;     ::= &#60;LABEL&#62;
				   | &#60;LABEL&#62; &#60;label-list&#62;

</PRE>

<P>
Note that both <CODE>&#60;LABEL&#62;</CODE> and <CODE>&#60;ATOM&#62;</CODE> refer to a single string
token of contiguous characters.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC77" HREF="pcpatr.html#TOC77">4.1.2  Logical constraint operations</A></H3>

<P>
Unification is the only mechanism implemented in the original PATR-II
formulism for imposing constraints on feature structures.  There are
situations where the desired constraint is not easily expressed in terms
of unification.  For example, consider the following rule:

<PRE>

Stem -&#62; Root Deriv:

		&#60;Stem ms&#62;  =  &#60;Root ms&#62;
		&#60;Stem ms&#62; &#60;=  &#60;Deriv msTo&#62;

</PRE>

<P>
where <CODE>&#60;Root ms&#62;</CODE> and <CODE>&#60;Deriv msFrom&#62;</CODE> have
the following feature structures:

<PRE>

[Root: [ms: [finite: - ...]]]

[Deriv: [msFrom: [tense: past ...]]]

</PRE>

<P>
Assume that from our knowledge of verb morphology, we would like to rule out
this analysis because only finite verb roots (<CODE>[finite: +]</CODE>) are
marked for tense.  The only way to do this with unification is to add
<CODE>[finite: +]</CODE> to the <CODE>msFrom</CODE> feature of all the
tense bearing derivational suffixes.  This would work, but it adds
information to suffixes that properly belongs only to roots.  A better
approach would be some way to express the desired constraint more directly.
Consider the following rule:

<PRE>

Stem -&#62; Root Deriv:
		&#60;Root ms&#62;  =  &#60;Deriv msFrom&#62;
		&#60;Stem ms&#62;  =  &#60;Root ms&#62;
		&#60;Stem ms&#62; &#60;=  &#60;Deriv msTo&#62;
		&#60;Stem ms&#62; ==  [finite: +] &#60;-&#62; [tense: []]

</PRE>

<P>
The fourth feature expression under the rule is a new operation called a
constraint.  This particular constraint is interpreted as follows: if the
feature structure <CODE>[finite: +]</CODE> <EM>subsumes</EM> the feature
structure that is the value of <CODE>&#60;Stem ms&#62;</CODE>, then the feature
structure <CODE>[tense: []]</CODE> must also subsume the feature structure
that is the value of <CODE>&#60;Stem ms&#62;</CODE>, and if the feature
structure <CODE>[finite: +]</CODE> does not subsume the feature structure
that is the value of <CODE>&#60;Stem ms&#62;</CODE>, then the feature structure
<CODE>[tense: []]</CODE> must not subsume the feature structure that is the
value of <CODE>&#60;Stem ms&#62;</CODE>.  (A feature structure <EM>F1</EM>
subsumes another feature structure <EM>F2</EM> if <EM>F1</EM> contains a
subset of the information contained by <EM>F2</EM>.  The empty feature
structure <CODE>[]</CODE> subsumes all other feature structures.  Subsumption
is a partial ordering: not every two feature structures are in a subsumption
relation to each other.)

</P>
<P>
A constraint is much different both syntactically and semantically from
either unification or priority union.  The first difference is that a
constraint does not modify any feature structures; it merely compares the
content of two feature structures.  The second difference is that the right
hand side of a constraint expression is a logical expression involving one or
more feature structures rather than a feature path.

</P>
<P>
Constraints support two unary and four binary logical operations:
existence, negation, logical and, logical or, conditional, and
biconditional.  The following tables summarize these logical operations.
(<CODE>$</CODE> is used for the subsumption operation.  <CODE>*P</CODE> represents
the feature structure pointed to by the feature path associated with the
logical constraint.  <CODE>F</CODE>, <CODE>L</CODE>, and <CODE>R</CODE> represent a
feature structure associated with the logical constraint.)

Since they apply to the final feature structure, constraint expressions
are evaluated after all of the unification and priority union
expressions.  Like unification and unlike priority union, the relative
order of constraints is not (logically) important.

</P>

A BNF grammar for PC-PATR logical constraint operations follows.

</PRE>

<P>
Note that both <CODE>&#60;LABEL&#62;</CODE> and <CODE>&#60;ATOM&#62;</CODE> refer to a
single string token of contiguous characters.

</P>
<P>
An <CODE>&#60;indexedvariable&#62;</CODE> is interpreted as a variable for the
atomic value at that place in the feature structure.  The
first such variable is instantiated by the atomic value of
the feature at that place in the feature-path.  All
subsequent instances of the variable are compared for
equality with the first instantiated one.

</P>
<P>
Why might one need such an indexed variable?  In some SOV
languages with pro-drop and noun-verb compounding, a clause
consisting just of a <CODE>Noun Verb</CODE> sequence is
potentially at least three ways ambiguous:

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>Subject Verb</CODE>
<LI>

<I>pro-drop</I> <CODE>Object Verb</CODE>
<LI>

<I>pro-drop</I> <CODE>Noun-Verb-compound</CODE>
</UL>

<P>
In at least one of these languages, it is the case that when
a noun-verb compound is possible, it is the only valid
reading.  Therefore, the correct thing to do is to ensure
that none of the other possible readings are allowed by the
grammar.

</P>
<P>
Here's a (simplified) example of how one can use indexed
variables to rule out the <CODE>Subject Verb</CODE> case.  (The
<CODE>Noun</CODE> is realized as the <CODE>DP</CODE> node and the
<CODE>Verb</CODE> is realized as a <CODE>VP</CODE> which is a daughter
of the <CODE>I'</CODE> node in the following rule.)

<PRE>
rule {IP option 2cI - subject initial, required, root clause}
IP = DP I'
	&#60;IP head&#62; = &#60;I' head&#62;
	&#60;IP head type root&#62; = +
	&#60;IP head type pro-drop&#62; = -
	   ...
	&#60;DP head case nominative&#62; = +
	   ...
	<B>&#60;IP head&#62; == [rootgloss:^1] -&#62;
				 ~ ( [type:[no_intervening:+]] &#38;
				   (( [subject:[head:[type:[compounds_with1:^1]]]]
					/ [subject:[head:[type:[compounds_with2:^1]]]])
					/ ([subject:[head:[type:[compounds_with3:^1]]]]
					/ [subject:[head:[type:[compounds_with4:^1]]]]) ) )</B>
	   ...
</PRE>

<P>
In the final logical constraint above (which is shown in
bold), the atomic value of the <CODE>rootgloss</CODE> feature is
stored in variable <CODE>^1</CODE> in the antecedent (the "if"
part) of the conditional.  This atomic value is then
compared with the values of the various
<CODE>compounds_with</CODE> features.  The idea is that the value
of the <CODE>rootgloss</CODE> feature should not be any of the
values of the various <CODE>compounds_with</CODE> features (there
are more than one of these because a given noun may compound
with more than one verb).

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC78" HREF="pcpatr.html#TOC78">4.2  Feature templates</A></H2>

<P>
A PC-PATR feature template has these parts, in the order listed:

<OL>
<LI>the keyword <CODE>Let</CODE>

<LI>the template name

<LI>the keyword <CODE>be</CODE>

<LI>a feature definition

<LI>an optional period (<CODE>.</CODE>)

</OL>

<P>
If the template name is a terminal category (a terminal symbol in one
of the phrase structure rules), the template defines the default
features for that category.  Otherwise the template name serves as an
abbreviation for the associated feature structure.

</P>
<P>
The characters <CODE>(){}[]&#60;&#62;=:</CODE> cannot be used in template names
since they are used for special purposes in the grammar file.  The
characters <CODE>/_</CODE> can be freely used in template names.  The
character <CODE>\</CODE> should not be used as the first character of a
template name because that is how fields are marked in the lexicon
file.

</P>
<P>
The abbreviations defined by templates are usually used in the feature
field of entries in the lexicon file.  For example, the lexical entry
for the irregular plural form <EM>feet</EM> may have the abbreviation
<EM>pl</EM> in its features field.  The grammar file would define this
abbreviation with a template like this:

<PRE>

Let pl be [number: PL]

</PRE>

<P>
The path notation may also be used:

<PRE>

Let pl be &#60;number&#62; = PL

</PRE>

<P>
More complicated feature structures may be defined in templates.  For
example,

<PRE>

Let 3sg be [tense:  PRES
			agr:    3SG
			finite: +
			vform:  S]

</PRE>

<P>
which is equivalent to:

<PRE>

Let 3sg be &#60;tense&#62;  = PRES
		   &#60;agr&#62;    = 3SG
		   &#60;finite&#62; = +
		   &#60;vform&#62;  = S

</PRE>

<P>
In the following example, the abbreviation <EM>irreg</EM> is defined using
another abbreviation:

<PRE>

Let irreg be &#60;reg&#62; = -
			 pl

</PRE>

<P>
The abbreviation <EM>pl</EM> must be defined previously in the grammar
file or an error will result.  A subsequent template could also use the
abbreviation <EM>irreg</EM> in its definition.  In this way, an
inheritance hierarchy features may be constructed.

</P>
<P>
Feature templates permit disjunctive definitions.  For example, the
lexical entry for the word <EM>deer</EM> may specify the feature
abbreviation <EM>sg-pl</EM>.  The grammar file would define this as a
disjunction of feature structures reflecting the fact that the word can
be either singular or plural:

<PRE>

Let sg/pl be {[number:SG]
			  [number:PL]}

</PRE>

<P>
This has the effect of creating two entries for <EM>deer</EM>, one with
singular number and another with plural.  Note that there is no limit
to the number of disjunct structures listed between the braces.  Also,
there is no slash (<CODE>/</CODE>) between the elements of the disjunction as
there is between the elements of a disjunction in the rules.
A shorter version of the above template using the path notation looks
like this:

<PRE>

Let sg/pl be &#60;number&#62; = {SG PL}

</PRE>

<P>
Abbreviations can also be used in disjunctions, provided that they
have previously been defined:

<PRE>

Let sg be &#60;number&#62; = SG
Let pl be &#60;number&#62; = PL
Let sg/pl be {[sg] [pl]}

</PRE>

<P>
Note the square brackets around the abbreviations <EM>sg</EM> and <EM>pl</EM>;
without square brackets they would be interpreted as simple values
instead.

</P>
<P>
Feature templates can assign default atomic feature values, indicated
by prefixing an exclamation point (!).  A default value can be
overridden by an explicit feature assignment.  This template says that
all members of category N have singular number as a default value:

<PRE>

Let N be &#60;number&#62; = !SG

</PRE>

<P>
The effect of this template is to make all nouns singular unless they
are explicitly marked as plural.  For example, regular nouns such as
<EM>book</EM> do not need any feature in their lexical entries to signal
that they are singular; but an irregular noun such as <EM>feet</EM> would
have a feature abbreviation such as <EM>pl</EM> in its lexical entry.
This would be defined in the grammar as <CODE>[number: PL]</CODE>, and would
override the default value for the feature number specified by the
template above.  If the N template above used <CODE>SG</CODE> instead of
<CODE>!SG</CODE>, then the word <EM>feet</EM> would fail to parse, since its
<EM>number</EM> feature would have an internal conflict between <CODE>SG</CODE>
and <CODE>PL</CODE>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC79" HREF="pcpatr.html#TOC79">4.3  Parameter settings</A></H2>

<P>
A PC-PATR parameter setting has these parts, in the order listed:

<OL>
<LI>the keyword <CODE>Parameter</CODE>

<LI>an optional colon (<CODE>:</CODE>)

<LI>one or more keywords identifying the parameter

<LI>the keyword <CODE>is</CODE>

<LI>the parameter value

<LI>an optional period (<CODE>.</CODE>)

</OL>

<P>
PC-PATR recognizes the following parameters:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Start symbol</CODE>
<DD>
defines the start symbol of the grammar.  For example,

<PRE>

Parameter Start symbol is S

</PRE>

declares that the parse goal of the grammar is the nonterminal category
S.  The default start symbol is the left hand symbol of the first
phrase structure rule in the grammar file.

<DT><CODE>Restrictor</CODE>
<DD>
defines a set of features to use for top-down filtering, expressed as a
list of feature paths.  For example,

<PRE>

Parameter Restrictor is &#60;cat&#62; &#60;head form&#62;

</PRE>

declares that the <EM>cat</EM> and <EM>head form</EM> features should be
used to screen rules before adding them to the parse chart.  The
default is not to use any features for such filtering.  This filtering,
named <EM>restriction</EM> in Shieber (1985), is performed in addition to
the normal top-down filtering based on categories alone.
RESTRICTION IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.  SHOULD IT BE INSTEAD OF
NORMAL FILTERING RATHER THAN IN ADDITION TO?

<DT><CODE>Attribute order</CODE>
<DD>
specifies the order in which feature attributes are displayed.  For
example,

<PRE>

Parameter Attribute order is cat lex sense head
							 first rest agreement

</PRE>

declares that the <EM>cat</EM> attribute should be the first one shown
in any output from PC-PATR, and that the other attributes should
be shown in the relative order shown, with the <EM>agreement</EM>
attribute shown last among those listed, but ahead of any attributes
that are not listed above.  Attributes that are not listed are ordered
according to their character code sort order.  If the attribute order
is not specified, then the category feature <EM>cat</EM> is shown first,
with all other attributes sorted according to their character codes.

<DT><CODE>Category feature</CODE>
<DD>
defines the label for the category attribute.  For example,

<PRE>

Parameter Category feature is Categ

</PRE>

declares that <EM>Categ</EM> is the name of the category attribute.  The
default name for this attribute is <EM>cat</EM>.

<DT><CODE>Lexical feature</CODE>
<DD>
defines the label for the lexical attribute.  For example,

<PRE>

Parameter Lexical feature is Lex

</PRE>

declares that <EM>Lex</EM> is the name of the lexical attribute.  The
default name for this attribute is <EM>lex</EM>.

<DT><CODE>Gloss feature</CODE>
<DD>
defines the label for the gloss attribute.  For example,

<PRE>

Parameter Gloss feature is Gloss

</PRE>

declares that <EM>Gloss</EM> is the name of the gloss attribute.  The
default name for this attribute is <EM>gloss</EM>.

<DT><CODE>RootGloss feature</CODE>
<DD>
defines the label for the root gloss attribute.  For example,

<PRE>

Parameter RootGloss feature is RootGloss

</PRE>

declares that <EM>RootGloss</EM> is the name of the root gloss attribute.  The
default name for this attribute is <EM>rootgloss</EM>.  Note that this does
not work when using Kimmo to parse words.

The rule definition consists of one or more mappings.  Each mapping has

<P>
Consider the information shown in figure 7.  When
the lexicon entry is loaded, it is initially assigned the feature
structure shown in figure 8, which is the unification
of the information given in the various fields of the lexicon entry.
Since one of the the labels stored in the <CODE>\f</CODE> (feature) field is
actually the name of a lexical rule, after the complete feature structure
has been built, the named lexical rule is applied.  After the rule has
been applied, the original single feature structure has been changed to
the two feature structures shown in figure 9.  Note that
not all of the input feature information is found in both of the output
feature structures.

<P>
Using a lexical rule in conjunction with the PC-Kimmo morphological
parser within PC-PATR is illustrated in
figures 10-12.
Figure 10 shows the lexical rule for mapping from
the top-level feature structure produced by the morphological parser to
the bottom-level feature structure used by the sentence parser.  Note
that this rule must be named <CODE>MapKimmoFeatures</CODE> (unorthodox
capitalization and all).
Figure 11 shows the feature structure
created by the PC-Kimmo parser.  After the lexical rule shown in
figure 10 has been applied (and after some
additional automatic processing), the feature structure shown in
figure 12 is passed to the PC-PATR parser.  Note that
only a single feature structure results from this operation, unlike the
result of a lexical rule applied to a lexicon entry.

</P>
<P>
Note that the feature structure passed to the PC-PATR parser
always has both a <CODE>lex</CODE> feature and a <CODE>gloss</CODE> feature, even
if the <CODE>MapKimmoFeatures</CODE> lexical rule does not create them.  The
default value for the <CODE>lex</CODE> feature is the original word from the
sentence being parsed.  The default value for the <CODE>gloss</CODE> feature
is the concatenation of the glosses of the individual morphemes in the
word.

</P>
<P>
In contrast to the <CODE>lex</CODE> and <CODE>gloss</CODE> features which are
provided automatically by default, the <CODE>cat</CODE> feature must be
provided by the <CODE>MapKimmoFeatures</CODE> lexical rule.  There is no way
to provide this feature automatically, and it is required for the
phrase structure rule portion of PC-PATR.

<H1><A NAME="SEC82" HREF="pcpatr.html#TOC82">5  Standard format</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>

</P>
<P>
Some of the input control files that PC-PATR reads are <EM>standard
format</EM> files.  This means that the files are divided into records and
fields.  A standard format file contains at least one record, and some
files may contain a large number of records.  Each record contains one
or more fields.  Each field occupies at least one line, and is marked
by a <EM>field code</EM> at the beginning of the line.  A field code
begins with a backslash character (<CODE>\</CODE>), and contains 1 or more
printing characters (usually alphabetic) in addition.

</P>
<P>
If the file is designed to have multiple records, then one of the field
codes must be designated to be the <EM>record marker</EM>, and every
record begins with that field, even if it is empty apart from the field
code.  If the file contains only one record, then the relative order of
the fields is constrained only by their semantics.

</P>
<P>
It is worth emphasizing that field codes must be at the
<EM>beginning</EM> of a line.  Even a single space before the backslash
character prevents it from being recognized as a field code.

</P>
<P>
It is also worth emphasizing that record markers <EM>must</EM> be present
even if that field has no information for that record.  Omitting the
record marker causes two records to be merge into a single record, with
unpredictable results.

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC83" HREF="pcpatr.html#TOC83">6  The PC-PATR Lexicon File</A></H1>

<P>
The lexicon file is a <EM>standard format</EM>
database file consisting of any number of records,
each of which represents one word.  These records are divided into
fields, each of which begins with a standard format marker at the
beginning of a line.  These markers begin with the <CODE>\</CODE> (backslash)
character followed by one or more alphanumeric characters.  Each record
begins with a designated field.  PC-PATR recognizes four
different fields, with these default field markers:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>\w</CODE>
<DD>
the lexical form of the word, spelled exactly as it will
appear in any sentences or phrases input to PC-PATR<A NAME="DOCF7" HREF="pcpatr.html#FOOT7">(7)</A>
<DT><CODE>\c</CODE>
<DD>
word category (part of speech)
<DT><CODE>\g</CODE>
<DD>
word gloss
<DT><CODE>\f</CODE>
<DD>
additional features of this word
</DL>
<P>
Note that the fields containing the lexical form of the word and its
category must be present for each word (record) in the lexicon.  The
other two fields (glosses and features) are optional, as are additional
fields that may be present for other purposes.

</P>
<P>
Each word loaded from the lexicon file is assigned certain features
based on the fields described above.

<UL>
<LI>The value of the <EM>lex</EM> feature is the lexical form of the word,

taken from the lexical form field of the word's entry in the lexicon.
<LI>The value of the <EM>cat</EM> feature is the lexical category of the word,

for example, Noun, Verb, Adjective, and so on.  This is taken from the
category field of the word's entry in the lexicon.  Note that the same
lexical form can appear multiple times in the lexicon, with a different
category for each occurrence.
<LI>The value of the <EM>gloss</EM> feature is the gloss of the word, taken

from the gloss field of the word's entry in the lexicon.  Unlike the
previous two items, this feature is optional.
</UL>

<P>
These feature names should be treated as reserved names and not used
for other purposes.

</P>
<P>
For example, consider these entries for the words <EM>fox</EM> and
<EM>foxes</EM>:

<PRE>

\w fox
\c N
\g canine
\f &#60;number&#62; = singular

\w foxes
\c N
\g canine+PL
\f &#60;number&#62; = plural

</PRE>

<P>
When these entries are used by the grammar, they are represented by these
feature structures:

<PRE>

[cat:    N
 gloss:  canine
 lex:    foxes
 number: singular]

[cat:    N
 gloss:  canine+PL
 lex:    foxes
 number: plural]

</PRE>

<P>
The lexicon entries can be simplified by defining feature templates in
the grammar file.  Consider the following templates:

<PRE>

Let PL be &#60;number&#62; = plural
Let N  be &#60;number&#62; = !singular

</PRE>

<P>
With these two templates, defining an abbreviation for "plural" and
defining a default feature for category N (noun), the lexicon entries
can be rewritten as follows:

<PRE>

\w fox
\c N
\g canine
\f

\w foxes
\c N
\g canine+PL
\f PL

</PRE>

<P>
Note that the feature (<CODE>\f</CODE>) field of the first entry could be
omitted altogether since it is now empty.

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC84" HREF="pcpatr.html#TOC84">7  The AMPLE Analysis File</A></H1>

<P>
Rather than using a dedicated lexicon file, PC-PATR can load its
internal lexicon from one or analysis files produced by the AMPLE
morphological analysis program.  AMPLE writes a standard format
database for its output, each record of which corresponds to a word of
the source text.  The first field of each entry contains the analysis.
Other fields, which may or may not occur, contain additional
information.

</P>
<P>
The utility of this command has been greatly reduced by the
availability of the <CODE>load ample</CODE> and <CODE>load kimmo</CODE>
commands which allow morphological analysis on demand to populate
PC-PATR's word lexicon.  However, the <CODE>file disambiguate</CODE>
command also operates on AMPLE analysis files, so this information is

each field.  Note that only those fields which contain analysis
information are marked for ambiguity.  The other fields (<CODE>\w</CODE>,
<CODE>\f</CODE>, <CODE>\c</CODE>, and <CODE>\n</CODE>) are the same regardless of the

<H1><A NAME="SEC98" HREF="pcpatr.html#TOC98">8  Using the Embedded Morphological Parsers</A></H1>

<P>
Normally, PC-PATR requires the linguist to develop a full-fledged
lexicon of words with their features.  This may be unnecessary if a
morphological analysis, and a comprehensive lexicon of morphemes, has
already been developed using either PC-Kimmo (version 2) or AMPLE
(version 3).  These morphological parsing programs are also available
from SIL.

</P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="pcpatr.html#SEC99">PC-Kimmo</A>
<LI><A HREF="pcpatr.html#SEC100">AMPLE</A>
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC99" HREF="pcpatr.html#TOC99">8.1  PC-Kimmo</A></H2>

<P>
Version 2 of PC-Kimmo supports a PC-PATR style grammar for defining
word structure in terms of morphemes.  This provides a straightforward
way to obtain word features as a result of the morphological analysis
process.  For best results, the (PC-Kimmo) word grammar and the
(PC-PATR) sentence or phrase grammar should be developed together.

</P>
<P>
When using the PC-Kimmo morphological parser, PC-PATR requires a
special lexical rule in the (sentence level) grammar file.
This rule is named <CODE>MapKimmoFeatures</CODE> and is used automatically to
map from the features produced by the word parse to the features needed
by the sentence parse.  For example, consider the following definition:

<PRE>

Define MapKimmoFeatures as
		&#60;out cat&#62;       = &#60;in head pos&#62;
		&#60;out lex&#62;       = &#60;in lex&#62;
		&#60;out head&#62;      = &#60;in head&#62;

</PRE>

<P>
This lexical rule uses the <CODE>&#60;head pos&#62;</CODE> feature produced by the
PC-Kimmo parser as the <CODE>&#60;cat&#62;</CODE> feature for the PC-PATR
parser, and passes the <CODE>&#60;lex&#62;</CODE> and <CODE>&#60;head&#62;</CODE> features from the
morphological parser to the sentence parser unchanged.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC100" HREF="pcpatr.html#TOC100">8.2  AMPLE</A></H2>

<P>
The only thing necessary to use the AMPLE morphological parser
inside PC-PATR is to load the appropriate control files and
dictionaries.  This will not be too useful, however, unless the
AMPLE dictionaries contain feature descriptors to pass through to
PC-PATR.  It is also required for the AMPLE data to define
the word category.  (Either the word-final suffix category or the
word-initial prefix category can be designated in the analysis data
file).  Consult the AMPLE documentation for more details on either
of these issues.

<P>The Microsoft Windows implementation uses the Microsoft C
QuickWin function, and the Macintosh implementation uses the Metrowerks C
SIOUX function.

<P>Gazdar and Mellish (1989, pages
142-147) discuss
why context-free phrase structure grammars are inadequate to model some

structures added to the context-free phrase structure rules) is shown
to be adequate for those cases.

<P>These two operators are
equivalent in PC-PATR, since the implementation treats each
lexical rule as an ordered list of assignments rather than using
unification for the mappings that have an equal sign operator.
