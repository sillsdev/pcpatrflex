A tool to use a PC-PATR grammar to (morphologically) disambiguate texts in FLEx

*Use PC-PATR with FLEx* is a 64-bit Windows program.  It does not run on any other platform.

*Use PC-PATR with FLEx* is a tool that can use a PC-PATR grammar to disambiguate a text or a portion of a text that has been analyzed
in a *FieldWorks Language Explorer* project. You tell *Use PC-PATR with FLEx* the PC-PATR grammar file to use.
Then you can choose a text or a portion of that text and ask *Use PC-PATR with FLEx* to try and disambiguate it.

*Use PC-PATR with FLEx* is compatible with version 9.1.18 or higher of FLEx.

While you can use any PC-PATR grammar file, *Use PC-PATR with FLEx* expects that you will have used the *PAWS* program to create 
the PC-PATR grammar file. See https://software.sil.org/paws/ for more on PAWS.
