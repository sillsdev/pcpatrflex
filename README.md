A tool to use a PC-PATR grammar to (morphologically) disambiguate texts in FLEx

*Use PC-PATR with FLEx* is a tool that can use a PC-PATR grammar to disambiguate a text or a portion of a text that has been analyzed
in a *FieldWorks Language Explorer* project. You tell *Use PC-PATR with FLEx* the PC-PATR grammar file and the FLEx project to use. 
Then you can choose a text or a portion of that text and ask *Use PC-PATR with FLEx* to try and disambiguate it.

*Use PC-PATR with FLEx* is compatible with any version of FLEx that is compatible with version 700072 of the FLEx database. 
It was developed with version 9.0.4 Beta of FLEx, so that version is known to work with *Use PC-PATR with FLEx*.

While you can use any PC-PATR grammar file, *Use PC-PATR with FLEx* expects that you will have used the *PAWS* program to create 
the PC-PATR grammar file. See https://software.sil.org/paws/ for more on this program.
